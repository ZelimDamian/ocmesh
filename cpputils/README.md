========

This little collection of various C++ utilities that I frequently use and I 
don't want to duplicate in every project anymore. It is composed by 
self-contained header files that can be used stand-alone.

## has_member.h
This header declares a utility trait to check if a class possess a member 
function that can be called with a given signature. Actually, the header 
declares a macro that generate the trait for each member name that one wants 
to check.

The macro is called ```DECLARE_HAS_MEMBER_TRAIT``` and given a name, 
e.g. ```get```, it generates a trait class called, for instance 
```has_member_get``` . 

The trait wants a signature as the template parameter and provides a static 
boolean constant ```value``` which will be true if a member with the given 
name exists and is callable with the given signature.

The macro also declares two tag ```struct```s called 
```has_member_<name>_tag``` and ```doesnt_have_<name>_tag```.
The trait provides a typedef ```type``` which can be one of the two tag structs,
useful for calling different implementation of a function with tag dispatching.

## static_table.h

This header declares a couple of utility functions to help the creation of 
instances of ```std::array``` at compile time. Given the limitations of C++11 
```constexpr``` functions and the lack of ```constexpr``` member functions in 
the C++11 ```std::array```, the generation of compile-time tables for 
precomputing values of any sort is much more difficult than how could be. 
These little utilities can help by providing a mean to generate tables with 
progressive indexes and transforming them in a functional way to create the 
desired table.

Provided functions are:
- ```irange<T, Begin, End>()``` returns a sequence filled of values of type 
  ```T``` in the range ```[Begin,Â End)```.
- ```iota<T, N>()``` returns a sequence filled of values of type ```T``` in 
  the range ```[0, End)```.
- ```map(<function>, <sequence>)``` maps the function over the sequence, 
  returning the mapped sequence.
- ```foldr(<function>, <zero>, <sequence>)``` and 
  ```foldl(<function>, <zero>, <sequence>)``` work exactly like the 
  corresponding functions in any functional language. They accumulate from the 
  right (or the left) the results of applying a binary function to the 
  elements of the sequence, returning the accumulated result.

The result of ```irange()```, ```iota()```, and ```map()``` can be converted 
to a ```std::array```, thus allowing to obtain the final compile-time computed 
table.

## std14 namespace

The headers in the ```std14/``` subdirectory provide a replacement for some of 
the missing pieces of the C++11 standard library that have been added in the 
recently published C++14 standard. Of all the things, I've added only those 
things that could have been directly added without modifying existing entities
(for example, there's not an entirely rewritten ```std::tuple``` library only
to add ```constexpr``` member functions). Of all, I've selected what I think 
are the must-haves.

Each header under ```std14/``` subdirectory is one-to-one with a standard 
header, and includes the standard one. All the declarations are enclosed in a 
namespace called ```std14```, because it's forbidden to add things to 
namespace ```std```. For convenience, the entire ```std``` namespace is 
imported inside it. However, when you compile your project in C++14 mode 
(because in the future you'll want to), all the declarations disappear and 
namespace ```std14``` becomes an alias for ```std```, so you can use the 
library-provided symbols out-of-the-box.

Provided entities are:
- ```std::make_unique``` in the ```std14/memory``` header
- Type traits aliases (e.g. ```enable_if_t<>``` instead of ```enable_if<>```)
  in ```std14/type_traits```
- ```std::integer_sequence``` and related facilities in the ```std14/utility```
  header.
