cpputils
========

This little collection of various C++ utilities that I frequently use and I 
don't want to duplicate in every project anymore. It is composed by 
self-contained header files that can be used stand-alone.

## has_member.h
This header declares a utility trait to check if a class possess a member 
function that can be called with a given signature. Actually, the header 
declares a macro that generate the trait for each member name that one wants 
to check.

The macro is called ```DECLARE_HAS_MEMBER_TRAIT``` and given a name, 
e.g. ```get```, it generates a trait class called, for instance 
 ```has_member_get``` . 

The trait wants a signature as the template parameter and provides a static 
boolean constant ```value``` which will be true if a member with the given 
name exists and is callable with the given signature.

The macro also declares two tag ```struct```s called 
 ```has_member_<name>_tag``` and ```doesnt_have_<name>_tag```.
The trait provides a typedef ```type``` which can be one of the two tag 
structs, useful for calling different implementation of a function with tag 
dispatching.

## meta.h

This header provides a few functions that are useful when writing function 
templates need to be enabled only when complex conditions are met.

### REQUIRES

The ```REQUIRES``` macro encapsulates the common idiom of using 
 ```std::enable_if```, but providing extra convenience. 
It is used as follows:
```cpp
template<typename T, REQUIRES(std::is_integral<T>::value)>
T sum(T v1, T v2) { return v1 + v2; }
```

Multiple macro invocations can be used in the same template, as long as they're
put on different lines. This is because the macro internally uses the 
 ```__LINE__``` preprocessor symbol, to be able to implement the following
feature. When using SFINAE to disable some function overload, the condition of 
 ```enable_if``` must be type-dependent in order to work. Otherwise, the 
condition expression is expanded at the first phase of the template parsing and
the substitution failure results in an error. The ```REQUIRES``` macro, on the
other hand, can always be used with non type-dependent conditions as well.

This is summarized in the following example:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class example {
public:
   /*
    * This doesn't work. It triggers an hard error if T is not integral,
    * because the condition is not type-dependent
    */
   template<typename U, 
            typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value>::type>
   U member(U u) { return u; }

   /*
    * This works as expected, even if the condition doesn't depend on the
    * template parameter
    */
   template<typename U, 
            REQUIRES(std::is_integral<T>::value)>
   U member(U u) { return u; }   
};
```

### Other functions

The other facilities provided by the header are a couple of ```constexpr```
functions, useful to compose complex SFINAE conditions.

* The ```all()``` and ```any()``` functions take a variadic set of boolean
  arguments and return true if all are true or, respectively, any of them is 
  true. They're especially useful to test the same property over all the
  parameters of a function template, for example:
  ```cpp
  template<typename ...Args,
           REQUIRES(all(std::is_integral<Args>::value...))>
  void something(Args ...args) { .... }
  ```

* The ```same_type``` function returns true if all of it's template
  arguments are the same type. This is particularly useful when you want to
  declare a variadic function, but only to have a variable number of arguments,
  while the type is known and fixed. For example ```any()``` above is declared
  as:
  ```cpp
  // You can't declare something like:
  // bool any(bool ...args)
  template<typename ...Args, // No way to constraint the type of the pack
           REQUIRES(same_type<bool, Args...>())>
  bool any(Args ...args) { ... }
  ```

* The ```void_t``` type trait is very simply a template typedef that always 
  corresponds to ```void```, no matter what you pass as the argument. The
  usefulness of this little utility in a lot of template metaprogramming
  techniques is well known. See for example, 
  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3911.pdf

* The ```true_t``` type trait is similar to ```void_t```, but is a value
  type trait that always return ```true```, no matter what.

## static_table.h

This header declares a couple of utility functions to help the creation of 
instances of ```std::array``` at compile time. Given the limitations of C++11 
 ```constexpr``` functions and the lack of ```constexpr``` member functions in 
the C++11 ```std::array```, the generation of compile-time tables for 
precomputing values of any sort is much more difficult than how could be. 
These little utilities can help by providing a mean to generate tables with 
progressive indexes and transforming them in a functional way to create the 
desired table.

Provided functions are:
- ```irange<T, Begin, End>()``` returns a sequence filled of values of type 
  ```T``` in the range ```[Begin,Â End)```.
- ```iota<T, N>()``` returns a sequence filled of values of type ```T``` in 
  the range ```[0, End)```.
- ```map(<function>, <sequence>)``` maps the function over the sequence, 
  returning the mapped sequence.
- ```foldr(<function>, <zero>, <sequence>)``` and 
  ```foldl(<function>, <zero>, <sequence>)``` work exactly like the 
  corresponding functions in any functional language. They accumulate from the 
  right (or the left) the results of applying a binary function to the 
  elements of the sequence, returning the accumulated result.

The result of ```irange()```, ```iota()```, and ```map()``` can be converted 
to a ```std::array```, thus allowing to obtain the final compile-time computed 
table.

## std14 namespace

The headers in the ```std14/``` subdirectory provide a replacement for some of 
the missing pieces of the C++11 standard library that have been added in the 
recently published C++14 standard. Of all the things, I've added only those 
things that could have been directly added without modifying existing entities
(for example, there's not an entirely rewritten ```std::tuple``` library only
to add ```constexpr``` member functions). Of all, I've selected what I think 
are the must-haves.

Each header under ```std14/``` subdirectory is one-to-one with a standard 
header, and includes the standard one. All the declarations are enclosed in a 
namespace called ```std14```, because it's forbidden to add things to 
namespace ```std```. For convenience, the entire ```std``` namespace is 
imported inside it. However, when you compile your project in C++14 mode 
(because in the future you'll want to), all the declarations disappear and 
namespace ```std14``` becomes an alias for ```std```, so you can use the 
library-provided symbols out-of-the-box.

Provided entities are:
- ```std::make_unique``` in the ```std14/memory``` header
- Type traits aliases (e.g. ```enable_if_t<>``` instead of ```enable_if<>```)
  in ```std14/type_traits```
- ```std::integer_sequence``` and related facilities in the ```std14/utility```
  header.
